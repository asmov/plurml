The Plur Framework defines a portable metalanguage standard for abstract software language concepts within the domain
of data model, structure, and protocol. The core definition library is known collectively as the Plur Metalanguage (PlurML).

PlurML abstractly defines concepts commonly found in various object-oriented programming languages in a general
manner. It provides language-specific definitions as well, which dictate how syntax is used directly.

PlurML provides a common way to refer to primitive types, values, interfaces, and classes along with common patterns for
how they may be used.

A lexical scanner and parser reads PlurML definition files (.plurml) for data models and interfaces and generates
source-code written in the desired language. Currently, PlurML supports Rust, Javascript, Java, and Python.
